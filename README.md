## UTA Bootcamp Challenge 10

In this homework assignment from the University of Texas-Austin Bootcamp we were asked to create a program that builds an HTML page using Node.js Inquirer.

## Description

Building this app gave me the opportunity to learn about and apply some basic knowledge of using Node.js to build an HTML page. The most challenging part was figuring out the syntax of how to get the index.js page to transfer the necessary array of objects to the makeHTML.js page. This challenge was pretty challenging, and allowed me to hone some data wrangling skills while learning to traverse the back-end.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

Be sure after downloading and unzipping the directory to run in your integrated terminal or command prompt in the appropriate directory:
- ```npm i```
- ```npm test```
- ```node index.js```


## Usage

Once the program is operating in the terminal, follow the prompts to answer questions about the type of employees that are being added to your department chart. Then, if desired, you can deploy the HTML page generated from the distribution (/dist) folder.

A lot of the HTML came from Bootstrap, just so I could focus on the back-end tasks.
